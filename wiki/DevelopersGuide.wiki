== Adding JScience to your local maven repo ==

I didn't see JScience in the maven v2 central repository so I went ahead and added it to my local repo manually.

Create the following directory structure in your local maven repo:
{{{
[User_Home].m2\repository\org\jscience\jscience\4.3
}}}
Copy the *jscience.jar* file to the *4.3* folder.

Rename the jar file to *jscience-4.3.jar*

Running *mvn package* should compile the code, run the junit tests and build the jar.
