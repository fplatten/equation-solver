Quick Start Guide to using equation-solver.  The examples listed below are from the com.showyourwork.test.ParserTest unit test.

The examples below include parsing the following examples:

  * Equations with implied multiplication.
  * Equations of polynomial fractions.
  * Equation which include standard fractions.
  * Solving Quadratic Equations.
  * Code example for finding the slope of an equation.
  * Code example for finding the X and Y intercept of an equation.
  * Code example for finding the first and second derivatives of an equataion.


== Details ==

Equations can be entered with all operations or without as the parser will insert implied multiplication operators.

*Without implied multiplication operators:*
{{{
(x-3)(x+5)-(x+2)(x-4) = 2x-5(x+4)
}}}

*Is converted to:*
{{{
(x-3)*(x+5)-1*(x+2)*(x-4) = 2*x-5*(x+4)
}}}


*Entering polynomial fractions:*
{{{
((4x + 3) / 5) - ((x + 4) / 3) - ((2x - 1) / 15) = 2
}}}
