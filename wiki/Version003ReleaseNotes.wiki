===Details===

Fixed a couple of issues.  The main error fixed was with the EquationParser method that inserts the implied multipliers.  The fixed bug caused a multiplier to be inserted when the equals sign precedes a variable.  This caused the solve for X solver to fail.


an example:  x-(3/x)-1=x-(4/x)-5 which should evaluate to x = -1/4
